       <p>My name is Rebecca Skier and my majors are Information Management with a concentration in web design, and Graphic Design. I am excited for this combination of majors as I am interested in UX/UI design, and together these programs will teach me both the creative and technological parts of web design. Here at Syracuse University I am a <strong>SUccess scholar</strong>, that is hard working and reliable.
